## How to Position Against This Literature

These papers establish that:
- Visual recognition without interaction generates belonging (established)
- Familiar strangers create comfort and security (established)
- Public familiarity has stronger effects than actual friendships (established)

Your contribution should be:
- The **cognitive/imaginative mechanism** — how seeing strangers affects mental model of "who we are as a community"
- Bridging **Benedict Anderson's imagined communities** to the micro/urban level
- Theorizing **solidarity formation** (not just belonging or comfort)
- Connecting to **Durkheim's collective representations** rather than just ontological security
