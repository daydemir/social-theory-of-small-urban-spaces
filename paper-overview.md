# Ambient Co-Presence Paper Overview

## Core Argument
Third places generate social cohesion through **ambient co-presence**—not through relationships (Coleman, Granovetter) or deliberation (Habermas). Familiar strangers shape our imagination of community without interaction.

---

## Theoretical Positioning

| Theorist | Mechanism | Your Distinction |
|----------|-----------|------------------|
| **Coleman** | Dense networks → norm enforcement | No closure required |
| **Granovetter** | Weak ties → instrumental activation | No relationship to activate |
| **Habermas** | Deliberation → public sphere | No conversation needed |
| **Durkheim** | Shared ritual → collective representations | *Build on this* |

---

## Nate's Feedback (Address These)

### 1. Coleman Connection?
> "Consistent co-presence generates shared norms, enforced in rare breaches"

**His example:** Commuter bus (same riders daily) vs city bus (different riders)

**To address:** Is your mechanism just Coleman's norms without closure? Or something distinct?
- Maybe: Coleman needs closure for *enforcement*; you're arguing co-presence affects *imagination* even without enforcement capacity
- The commuter bus example is good—test case for when ambient co-presence does/doesn't generate norms

### 2. Status & Style of Life
> "Common standards of taste, aesthetics, self-presentation—no tie or deliberation"

**Readings:** Weber (Class, Status, Party), Bourdieu (Distinction)

**To address:** Does ambient co-presence transmit status markers and aesthetic norms? Could be a secondary mechanism alongside imagination.

## Key Readings to Engage

**Primary:**
- Granovetter (Sept 9) — position against
- Habermas (Oct 28) — position against
- Coleman (Sept 23) — engage Nate's question
- Durkheim (Nov 4) — collective representations as your mechanism

**Secondary:**
- Weber/Bourdieu (Sept 30) — status/style transmission
- Wimmer (Sept 16) — boundary formation, contact effects
- Young (Sept 23) — marginalization through spatial segregation

**External (not on syllabus):**
- Milgram — familiar strangers (describe, didn't theorize function)
- Oldenburg — third places (requires interaction, you go beyond)
- Jacobs — eyes on street (safety, not cohesion)
- Goffman — civil inattention (managing co-presence, not building cohesion)
- Lofland — public realm (navigating strangerness, not solidarity)
- Anderson — cosmopolitan canopy (requires interaction, you go beyond)

## Urban Sociology Tradition (Engage These)

### Goffman — Civil Inattention (1963, 1971)
**Core idea:** Strangers maintain public order through micro-rituals. "Civil inattention" = briefly acknowledge others then look away. Respects privacy, signals non-threat.

**Your distinction:** Goffman is about *managing* co-presence (how we avoid awkwardness). You're about co-presence *building* something (imagination, cohesion).

**Source:** [Civil Inattention - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_inattention)

---

### Lofland — A World of Strangers (1973) / The Public Realm (1998)
**Core idea:** How do cities work when we're surrounded by strangers? We categorize strangers by location and appearance. The "public realm" = social space dominated by stranger-to-stranger relations.

**Your distinction:** Lofland asks how we *navigate* strangerness. You ask what co-presence *does* to our imagination of community.

**Source:** [Lofland - Public Realm (SAGE)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/089124189017004004)

---

### Anderson — Cosmopolitan Canopy (2004, 2011)
**Core idea:** Certain public spaces (markets, terminals) create "islands of civility" where diverse strangers interact positively. "Folk ethnography" = people observe and learn about others.

**Your distinction:** Anderson's canopies are spaces where **interaction happens** (lunch counters, conversation). You're theorizing **pure ambient co-presence** without interaction.

## Literature Gap You Fill

| Existing Work | Their Mechanism | Your Extension |
|---------------|-----------------|----------------|
| Oldenburg | Conversation in third places | Co-presence without interaction |
| Milgram | Described familiar strangers | Theorize their social function |
| Jacobs | Eyes on street → safety | Eyes on street → imagined solidarity |
| Contact hypothesis | Interaction reduces prejudice | Recognition without interaction |
| **Goffman** | Managing co-presence (rituals) | Co-presence *building* cohesion |
| **Lofland** | Navigating strangerness | Co-presence shaping imagination |
| **Anderson** | Interaction under cosmopolitan canopy | Pure co-presence, no interaction needed |

---

## Mechanism to Develop

```
Spatial proximity → Regular co-presence → Recognition of diverse others
    ↓
Mental model of "who we are as a community" (Durkheim)
    ↓
Reduced othering + Increased latent cooperation + Social cohesion
```

## Open Questions

1. **Coleman distinction:** Is norm formation through co-presence different from Coleman's closure-based norms? (Nate's question)

2. **Scope conditions:** When does ambient co-presence work?
   - Regularity required? (commuter bus vs city bus)
   - Public accessibility?
   - Diversity of users?

3. **Status angle:** Is style-of-life transmission (Weber/Bourdieu) a parallel mechanism or the same one?

4. **Empirical implications:** What would distinguish your theory from alternatives? (for future work, not this paper)

---

## Paper Structure (Suggested)

1. **Puzzle:** Third places matter for social cohesion, but why? Existing theories require interaction.
2. **Literature:** Position against Granovetter, Habermas, and engage Coleman
3. **Theory:** Ambient co-presence → collective representations → imagined solidarity
4. **Mechanism:** How recognition without relationship affects cognition
5. **Scope conditions:** When this works (regularity, accessibility, diversity)
6. **Implications:** For urban design, polarization, community-building

## Additional Research Findings

### The Term "Ambient Co-Presence"

**Madianou (2016)** coined "ambient co-presence" = peripheral yet intense awareness of others made possible through constant exposure. Originally about digital media, but applies to physical spaces. Key finding: ambient awareness produces "low-level emotional reassurance" and connection WITHOUT interaction.

**Source:** [Ambient Co-presence: Transnational Family Practices](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/glob.12105)

### Familiar vs Unfamiliar Strangers

**Key distinction for your paper:**

| | Familiar Stranger | Unfamiliar Stranger |
|---|---|---|
| **Example** | Same bus daily, regular at same bar | Tourist, new city |
| **Mechanism** | Mere exposure effect builds trust | No accumulated exposure |
| **Outcome** | Ontological security, belonging | Anonymity, potential threat |

**Zahnow & Corcoran (2025):** Familiar strangers create "comfort zones" with strong belonging and attachment. Public familiarity has **stronger effects on belonging than actual friendships**.

**Source:** [From communal places to comfort zones (2025)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/00420980241265033)

**Mere Exposure Effect (Zajonc 1968):** Repeated exposure increases liking without interaction. Maximum effect at 10-20 exposures. Creates trust based solely on familiarity, not knowledge.

**Source:** [Mere-exposure effect - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mere-exposure_effect)

---

### Physical vs Mediated Presence

**Why physical co-presence is different from learning about others via news/internet:**

| Physical Co-Presence | Mediated Knowledge |
|---|---|
| Embodied, multisensory | Filtered, curated |
| Spatially determined (forced diversity) | Algorithmically curated (echo chambers) |
| Creates weak ties and bridging capital | Parasocial = one-way, no reciprocity |
| Unavoidable encounter | Selective attention |

**Simmel's Stranger Paradox:** Physical proximity creates unique urban consciousness—"near and far at the same time." Can't replicate through media.

**Contact Hypothesis:** Face-to-face reduces prejudice more than virtual (r = -0.22 vs r = -0.12).

### Theories of Social Cohesion (Non-Interactional)

**Benedict Anderson - Imagined Communities (1983)**
Originally about nationalism, but applies to cities: solidarity through imagination of shared membership, not actual interaction. "In the minds of each lives the image of their communion."

**Source:** [Imagined Community - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imagined_community)

**Robert Sampson - Collective Efficacy (1997)**
Social cohesion + willingness to intervene for common good. Key finding: **does NOT require dense friendship networks**. "Social control of crime may be facilitated by strong ties but does not necessarily require cohesive ties."

**Source:** [Neighborhoods and Violent Crime - Science](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.277.5328.918)

**Iris Marion Young - Being Together of Strangers (1990)**
City life = "being together of strangers in openness to group difference." Urban cohesion emerges from **mediation of thousands of strangers**, not interpersonal bonds. Strangers remaining strangers is the point.

**Source:** [Iris Marion Young on City Life](https://www.thepolisblog.org/2012/12/iris-marion-young-on-city-life.html)

### Norms & Aesthetics Through Observation

**How norms spread without interaction:**

1. **Descriptive norms** — observing what people DO signals what's acceptable
2. **Informational social influence** — others as sources of "correct" behavior
3. **Mere exposure → perceived prevalence** — seeing behaviors makes them seem normative

**Bourdieu's Habitus:** Tastes and dispositions transmitted through "unconscious socialization" — watching and emulating, not explicit teaching. "Disguised manner" of cultural transmission.

**Social Contagion:** Visibility is the primary driver, not network ties. Minority of visible behaviors can shift perceived norms.

**Source:** [Simple Rules of Social Contagion - Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep04343)

---

### Complicating Factors (Address These)

1. **Durkheim's collective effervescence** requires shared attention/synchronization, not just co-presence. Mere co-presence may not be sufficient.

2. **Initial attitudes matter** for mere exposure effect — if initial exposure is negative, repeated exposure increases dislike.

3. **Anderson's cosmopolitan canopy** shows "folk ethnography" (observation) shapes imagination — but his examples involve spaces where interaction DOES happen.
