Most of our social interfacing are not interactions at all. We frequently see, walk by, sit near, and notice others. But we only interact with a small subset of those who are nearby. We can call this form of non-interactive proximity ambient co-presence.

In cities, the divergence between those with whom we share ambient co-presence and those with whom we actually interact is especially pronounced. We might rub shoulders with hundreds of people for every one interaction. On a walk down a busy street in New York City, that could become thousands.

Even without the traditional forms of interaction, we know that this social interfacing is meaningful. [more on existing literature, zahnow and more]. We can imagine a

Let's create a typology of co-presence. 

We can describe a moment where co-presence occurs between two individuals as an event. We can then divide these events into two types we've already described: co-presence that involves an interaction (maybe we can call this engaged co-presence) and co-presence that does not, which we call ambient. This division is not always clear. How many words shared constitutes an interaction? Is eye contact an interaction? Is wordlessly holding a door for someone else an interaction? 

For our purposes, we should focus only on co-presence that can be uncontroversially defined as non-interactive. This means that the strongest co-presence we will consider ambient is an event where person A consciously observes person B, and person A has no knowledge of whether B reciprocated in any conscious noticing of A. Considering ambient co-presence this way allows us to guarantee that any impact an A from the event is irrespective of B's actions. If A consciously sees B acknowledging or responding to A in any way, then we will not consider that event to be one of ambient co-presence. For example, if A and B make eye contact their interaction is no longer only ambient.

This means the whole event is lived inside A's own mind, and any impacts on A occur solely in A's imagination. In a purely ambient co-presence event, nothing is enacted or tested outside the mind. Still, these encounters do shape our perception. We can also then differentiate between the observer (A) and the subject (B) in any ambient co-presence event.

We have described a one-sided, conscious observation as an example of an ambient co-presence event. But we can also include the unconscious or subconscious noticing of others as well. ambient co-presence could also be described by B sitting in A's peripheral vision, with no need for A to consciously observe or even acknowledge to themselves the presence of B. This allows us to differentiate two types of ambient co-presence: conscious and unconscious.

But this is not the only way we can differentiate types of ambient co-presence. In an ambient co-presence event, the observer may recognize the subject. Perhaps on a commuter train where riders might often see familiar faces, or at a bar where others also frequent. So we can differentiate between familiar and unfamiliar ambient co-presence.

Let's see the types of ambient co-presence we've described here.

no question about impact on aesthetics, see fashion

what about impact on norms, coleman
 - norms are enforced not through any two-sided interaction, but through a series of ambient interactions (no two people necessarily need to make eye contact for a norm to be enforced)
 - if someone is playing loud music on a train
    - i may see others' reactions, and see that as enforcement
    - it may bother me, and thus through ambient co-presence i derive my own categorical imperative


imagined communities / solidarity
 - familiar events create solidarity



qualities of ambient co-presence
 - ethnic proximity, etc


ambient as a lead to engaged co-presence
