# Ambient Co-Presence: Paper Outline

**Due: Dec 4 | Max: 3750 words**

---

## Your Contribution
- Existing lit: public familiarity → individual belonging/comfort
- Your gap: **mechanism** (how observation → imagination) + **solidarity** (collective, not individual)
- Theoretical move: Anderson + Young + Durkheim at urban scale

---

## Answer Nate's Questions
- **Coleman?** No — Coleman needs closure for enforcement. You = imagination without closure.
- **Commuter vs city bus?** Regularity matters for familiar strangers, but mechanism is imagination, not enforcement.
- **Status/aesthetics?** One sentence max — secondary to solidarity argument.

## Outline

### 1. Introduction (400w)
- Puzzle: co-presence without interaction → solidarity. How?
- Position against: Coleman, Granovetter, Habermas (all require interaction)
- Thesis: ambient co-presence → collective imagination → solidarity

### 2. Existing Accounts (600w)
- Blokland/Zahnow: public familiarity → belonging/comfort
- Gap: individual outcomes, mechanism underspecified, no solidarity

### 3. Ambient Co-Presence Defined (400w)
- Not familiar strangers (requires repetition)
- Not civil inattention (managing ≠ building)
- Physical vs mediated (forced diversity vs algorithmic)

### 4. Mechanism: Collective Imagination (800w)
- Anderson: imagined communities → urban scale
- Young: "being together of strangers"
- Durkheim: collective representations via observation, not effervescence
- Seeing diverse others populates mental model of "who we are"

### 5. Distinction from Coleman (500w)
- Coleman = closure → enforcement
- You = imagination without closure
- Commuter vs city bus example

### 6. Scope & Implications (300w)
- Regularity helps (familiar > unfamiliar)
- Physical matters (vs digital curation)
- Urban design, polarization

### 7. Conclusion (250w)
- Contribution: mechanism for non-interactional solidarity
- Extends Anderson/Young/Durkheim to urban micro-level

## Key Examples
- Commuter bus vs city bus (Nate's)
- Metro — seeing city's diversity daily
- Bar regulars — comfort without speaking
