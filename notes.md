- In active shared spaces and third places, we experience significant co-presence with other people from our neighborhood, city, and region. The connections with others in these spaces are not strong enough to be weak ties. Still, these strangers, sometimes familiar strangers, hold a place in our imagination and impact how we relate to our community. The dynamics are not relationship-based (Coleman, Granovetter) nor deliberation-based (Habermas). Ambient co-presence in public spaces presents a different mode of relation that increases social cohesion.
