    // Note: For selection-based word count in Markdown and LaTeX:
    // - In VS Code: The "Selection Word Count" extension is installed and will show
    //   word count of selected text automatically in the status bar
    // - In Cursor: The extension marketplace is limited. You may need to:
    //   1. Manually install the VSIX from https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=witulski.selection-word-count
    //   2. Or use VS Code for editing when you need selection word counts
