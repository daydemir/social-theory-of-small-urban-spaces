The Social Theory of Small Urban Spaces
In active shared spaces and third places, we experience significant co-presence with other people from our neighborhood, city, and region. The connections with others in these spaces are not strong enough to be weak ties. Still, these strangers, sometimes familiar strangers, hold a place in our imagination and impact how we relate to our community. The dynamics are not relationship-based (Coleman, Granovetter) nor deliberation-based (Habermas). Ambient co-presence in public spaces presents a different mode of relation that increases social cohesion.

The point would be to theorize what that “ambient co-presence” provides for our imagination and our social cohesion. Let me know if you have any thoughts or if you think I should try a different direction. Thanks!

Sounds great to me. Go for it.

I wonder if it’s not Coleman-esque though? Like consistent co-presence in a space generates shared norms, which are then enforced in rare breaches. I think of the difference between a bus for commuters, who see each other every day even though they don’t interact, and a city line bus with different riders all the time. 

I also wonder if status and shared style of life is relevant. Again, no relational tie or deliberation. But perhaps common standards of taste, aesthetics and self-presentation.

Anyway, excited to see where you take this.
